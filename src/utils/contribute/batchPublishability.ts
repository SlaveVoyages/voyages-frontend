/**
 * Whether a batch can be published, decided from the contributions the batch

 *
 * The server refuses a batch for two distinct reasons, and both are knowable
 * before asking it:
 *
 * - any contribution still Submitted — "Batch has contributions without an
 *   editorial decision"
 * - nothing Accepted — "No accepted contributions found in batch"
 *
 * Deciding it here turns a round trip and a refusal into a disabled button with
 * the reason attached. The rules are duplicated from the server on purpose: this
 * is a courtesy check, and the server stays the authority. If the two ever
 * disagree the publish is still refused correctly — the button is just wrong
